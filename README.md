## Introduction

This is my personal website for presenting myself as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I decided for a minimal design with two colors and little distraction. This will be improved and changed as I go along my journey as a developer.

## Features

- About me section
- Projects section with most recent projects
- Contact section
- Designed with accessibility in mind (effective color contrast, aria roles...)

## Interactivity

- Dark mode with use of system preference, storing choice in local storage
